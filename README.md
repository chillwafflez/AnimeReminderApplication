# AnimeReminderApplication

### Background
Hello! This is a project I created in order to practice using Python and APIs
Anime are animated shows originating from Japan and AniList is a website that tracks
your episode progression for anime shows. This Python script uses the AniList API 
to fetch anime shows I am currently watching and that are also currently releasing 
episodes. 

### How It Works
I made this project completely in Python and utilized different libraries. These
libraries include win10toast in order to create Windows 10 notifications and 
schedule, in order to set the actual reminders.

### How To Run
In order to use this application, you first must clone the Git repository. To clone
the repository, navigate to the test branch (I have not moved the files to main yet),
and copy the URL for the repository. Next, open the Git Bash and type "git clone"
followed by the URL you copied. Before running, enter your AniList profile username
in the username.txt. Then you are good to go!
